# JWT Lab - Realistic Answer Key

This answer key provides a comprehensive walkthrough of the new, stateless JWT-only vulnerable lab. It covers the vulnerabilities, exploitation steps, and secure implementation advice. Use this guide for educational purposes only.

## üéØ Lab Overview

This lab simulates a real-world web application with the following JWT-related vulnerabilities:
1. **Weak/Guessable Secret Key**
2. **Algorithm Confusion (alg:none)**
3. **No Signature Verification**
4. **Role-Based Access Control Bypass**

The application uses JWTs for all authentication and authorization. There are no session cookies or Flask-Login.

## üìù Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Initial Setup and Registration

1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   docker build -t jwt-lab .
   docker run -p 5000:5000 jwt-lab
   ```
2. Access the app at `http://localhost:5000`
3. Register a new user account via the Register page.
4. Log in with your new credentials.

### 2. Analyzing the JWT Token

1. After login, you are redirected to the dashboard.
2. Your JWT token is displayed on the dashboard. Copy it using the provided button.
3. You can also view the decoded payload at `http://localhost:5000/api/user`.
4. Paste your token into [jwt.io](https://jwt.io) to analyze its structure.

### 3. Identifying Vulnerabilities

#### 1. **Weak Secret Key**
- The JWT is signed with a weak secret by default
- This can be brute-forced using tools like [jwt-tool](https://github.com/ticarpi/jwt_tool) or [jwt-cracker](https://github.com/brendan-rius/jwt-cracker).

#### 2. **Algorithm Confusion (alg:none)**
- The backend does not verify the signature or algorithm.
- You can create a token with `alg: none` and no signature, and it will be accepted.

#### 3. **No Signature Verification**
- The backend decodes JWTs with `verify_signature: False`.
- Any valid JWT structure is accepted, even if unsigned or tampered with.

#### 4. **Role-Based Access Control Bypass**
- The `/admin` endpoint only checks the `role` claim in the JWT, not the database.
- If you set `role: admin` in your token, you gain admin access.

## üö© Exploiting the Vulnerabilities

### **A. Brute-Forcing the Secret Key**
1. Copy your JWT token from the dashboard.
2. Use a tool like `jwt-tool`:
   ```bash
   jwt_tool.py <your_token> -C -d -S wordlist.txt
   ```
3. Once you discover the secret, you can sign your own tokens.

### **B. Role Escalation (Privilege Escalation)**
1. Decode your JWT at [jwt.io](https://jwt.io).
2. Change the payload to:
   ```json
   {
     "user_id": 1,
     "username": "your_username",
     "role": "admin",
     ...
   }
   ```
3. Re-sign the token with the discovered secret.
4. Replace the `token` cookie in your browser with your new token.
5. Visit `/admin`‚Äîyou now have admin access.

### **C. Algorithm Confusion Attack**
1. At [jwt.io](https://jwt.io), set the header to:
   ```json
   { "alg": "none", "typ": "JWT" }
   ```
2. Set the payload to:
   ```json
   { "user_id": 1, "username": "your_username", "role": "admin" }
   ```
3. Remove the signature (everything after the second period).
4. Set this as your `token` cookie.
5. Visit `/admin`‚Äîaccess is granted, even with no signature!

## üîí Secure Implementation

To fix these vulnerabilities:

1. **Use a strong, random secret key** (not guessable, not in code or env by default).
2. **Always verify the JWT signature and algorithm**:
   ```python
   payload = jwt.decode(token, Config.SECRET_KEY, algorithms=[Config.JWT_ALGORITHM], options={"verify_signature": True})
   ```
3. **Never accept `alg: none`** or unsigned tokens.
4. **Check user roles against the database, not just the JWT.**
